Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ridwan Rais!

This is my final project that I've done from a course called [Becoming an Expert Developer](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/276) provided by Dicoding.

This API implements essential software design for a professional project, including Clean Architecture, Unit Testing, and dependency injection.

To build the API, I use NodeJS and Hapi Framework for the router. For the database, I use PostgreSQL.
